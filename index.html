                    <p>At Kaanger Valley Academy, Raipur, the Physical Education and Sports Programme is about passion, grit, improvement and perfection. Passion to be one with the cause, grit to work harder each day, improvement to acknowledge your shortcomings & work on them and perfection to achieve excellence. KVA acknowledges Physical Education and Sports Programme as an integral part of the growth and development of each student. It focuses on participation, competition and achieving excellence in various sports and games, thus enabling the coaches and trainers to channel latent energies and talents of our students. We offer gradual individual growth and development plan for each student under the expert supervision of our Physical Education instructors, coaches and trainers. Initiating the mind with Yoga and harnessing energy by physical training exercises ensure that the students not only are fit but are also mentally strong. With innumerable choices to make from an array of indoor games like Table Tennis, Chess, Squash, Swimming, Badminton, Skating, to outdoors sports like Athletics, Football, Cricket, Basketball, Lawn Tennis along with Martial Arts, Aerobics, fitness and Horse Riding, KVA enables a child to explore every dimension of Physical Education. Experiencing leadership, teamwork, competition, patience, appreciation and respect is the very essence of our Physical Education and Sports Programme. At KVA we believe in the fact that - 'It's not about being better than someone else; it's about being better than you were the day before.'</p>
